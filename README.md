# stats_101_py
A collection of jupyter notebooks that solve stats 101 problems on git hub to practice all 3 things  

I am new to statistics and python and github. I feel the best way to learn all 3 things is to do so symultaneously.

I'm open to suggestions and help with any of the above. 
I'm interested is incorporating numpy, pandas, and the display features of sympy into the notebooks along with whatever else I dont know about yet which would be relevant.

I know many andvanced stat functions are available in the scipy library, but I'd rather build out the formulas more manually so everyone can read all the steps and how they relate to the manual process. 

My goal is to build out a set of notebooks that future students can use as a tool. 

Thanks for visiting.
